# Unattended Install Script for ERPNext
Unattended script for ERPNext installation (Supports Versions 13, 14, 15, and Develop).

This is a comprehensive, interactive script for installing ERPNext Versions 13, 14, 15, and the develop branch. You can set up either development or production environments with enhanced features including intelligent additional apps installation, comprehensive logging, and smart branch detection.

## 🆕 What's New in This Version

### Enhanced Features
- **Develop Branch Support**: Added comprehensive warnings and support for the bleeding-edge develop branch
- **Intelligent Additional Apps Installation**: Automated discovery and installation of 50+ compatible Frappe apps
- **Smart Branch Detection**: Automatically detects and uses the best available branch for each app
- **Improved Error Handling**: Multiple installation strategies and graceful fallbacks
- **Better User Experience**: Clearer prompts, progress indicators, and informative messages

### Major Additions
- **Additional Apps Marketplace**: Browse and install from 50+ curated Frappe applications
- **Compatibility Checking**: Automatic validation for ERPNext v15/develop (pyproject.toml requirements)
- **Branch Intelligence**: Frappe apps use appropriate version branches, third-party apps use default branches
- **Installation Strategies**: Multiple fallback methods for app installation (setup.py extraction, name transformations, directory scanning)

## 🔧 How To Use

### Before Installation

Make sure you install the latest package versions by updating system packages if you are running this script on a fresh Ubuntu machine.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```
and then reboot your machine 

### ⚠️ Important!
Do not run this script as root as it will fail when setting up the site. If your VPS default user is root, create a non-root user by following these steps:

1. Create a new user (you can change frappeuser to your preferred user name):
```bash
sudo adduser frappeuser
Full Name []: frappeuser
Room Number []:
Work Phone []:
Home Phone []:
Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y]
```
2. Add the user to sudoers:
```bash
usermod -aG sudo frappeuser
```
3. Switch to created user:
```bash
su frappeuser
```
4. Ensure you're on created user's home directory:
```bash
cd /home/frappeuser
```
To manually add a user to the sudoers file, follow these steps:

1. Switch to Root User:
```
su root
```
2. Edit Sudoers File:
```
visudo
```
3. Add User Entry: Add the following line under the user privilege specification:
```
user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
4. Save and Exit: Press CTRL+X, then Y, and Enter to save and exit.

Continue with the next steps below.

## 🚨 Important Disclaimers

### Version Compatibility & Installation Conflicts

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Different ERPNext versions should NOT be installed on the same server!**

Installing multiple ERPNext versions (e.g., v15 + develop, or v14 + v15) on the same server can cause:
- **Redis port conflicts** (develop uses ports 11000, 12000, 13000 vs standard 6379)
- **Node.js version conflicts** (v13/v14 use Node 16, v15/develop use Node 18/20)
- **Supervisor configuration conflicts** (different service management approaches)
- **Database schema incompatibilities** (version-specific database changes)
- **Python dependency conflicts** (different package version requirements)
- **System instability and service failures**

**Recommended Approach:**
- **One ERPNext version per server/container**
- **Use separate servers** for production and development environments
- **Backup and completely remove** existing installations before installing different versions
- **Use Docker containers** for isolated testing of different versions

The script automatically detects existing installations and warns about potential conflicts.

### Develop Branch Warning
The **develop branch** contains bleeding-edge, experimental code that:
- Changes daily and may be unstable
- Can cause data corruption or system crashes  
- Is NOT suitable for production or important data
- Has limited community support

**Recommended for**: Experienced developers testing new features  
**Better alternatives**: Version 15 (stable) or Version 14 (proven)

### Additional Apps Installation
When installing additional Frappe apps, please note:
- App compatibility may vary between ERPNext versions
- Some apps might fail to install due to version mismatches or missing dependencies
- Third-party apps use their own versioning schemes
- Installation success is not guaranteed for all environments

## 📦 Additional Apps Feature

- **Smart Selection**: Interactive dialog for easy app selection

### How It Works

2. **Compatibility Validation**: Checks for pyproject.toml requirements (v15/develop)
3. **Branch Detection**: Automatically selects the best available branch for each app
4. **Multiple Installation Strategies**: Falls back through different installation methods
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed success/failure reporting with error details

### Supported App Categories
